# Twofactorbox
This was a project created for a class.
We plan on making a lockbox that utilizes the email functionality of the pi to act as a
second step of authentication. The project will consist of a lockbox with a keypad attached on the
outside. The locking mechanism consists of a motor, a hook, and catch on the inside of the box. The user has a default pin that when entered acts as the first part of authentication. Once the correct first code is entered the user is sent an email with a randomly generated 4 digit pin that acts as the second code, once this is entered the box is unlocked. The box will also have a security system consisting of a camera and a motion sensor. If the codes are not entered and the box is opened the sensor will activate the camera and send an email to the user with a pictures taken as soon as the sensor is activated.
